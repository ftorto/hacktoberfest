# hacktoberfest
A repo for hacktoberfest

I made this profile just for hacktoberfest tshirt

I hope the quality of the tshirt is good

I really wish there was some other colour variant of the tshirt available as well

Although I did learn a thing or two about deleting branches and apps for merging automatically nad rebasing while merging

Also, contact me if you want the tshirt :)

oh boy, another year of hacktoberfest <3

I hope I get an extra tshirt this time too

I gave my last year's tshirt to my roomie, he was happy :)

whoaa I didn't think that a simple readme would get merge conflicts. I legit learn so much every time I make this high quality pull request.
